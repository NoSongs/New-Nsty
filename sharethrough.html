			<p>It was actually in the ad world where I really began to understand the value in getting up close and personal with who you are designing for and the importance of being able to iterate quickly and effectively. With little (and by that I mean, none) experience in the industry, I had to jump in headfirst to a world where time is money and every eyeball youâ€™re designing for has a dollar sign attached. During my time at Sharethrough, I was lucky enough to work alongside Janice Frasier and the Luxr program to mentor and guide me as I applied lean UX methodologies to the design of campaign dashboards and a self-serve native ad platform.</p>

			<p>For deep insight into specifically who I was designing for, I spent a ton of time shadowing the end user, interviewing them and doing exercises to better understand their needs to provide a product that would make their already hectic lives, less busy and more effective. The goal was to create easy to use dashboards that would deliver them important, customizable ad tracking data. We came up with three main personas and users of the ad platform: Campaign coordinators, media planners and creatives. Because each user had very different needs and goals, the product needed to be flexible enough to meet all their various use cases.</p>

			<p>My strategy was to start with something minimal, allow users to tool around with it and see where they wanted to go with it, and then build features out iteratively. If we noticed specific features necessary for their workflow were extremely important we would prioritize them while leaving the less critical features in a minimal state or just disregard them completely from the product.</p>

			<p>In addition to designing the ad platforms, I also led the creation of an interactive website housing video advertising content. The goal was to create a desirable industry destination (sharethrough.tv) that would highlight the best viral video ad content out there, positioning the company as a thought leader in the space.</p>
